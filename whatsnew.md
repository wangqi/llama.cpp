### 7. Model Support

- **New models added**:
  - OLMo3 (#16015)
  - Grok-2 (#15539)
  - Llama4ForCausalLM (#16042)
  - Nemotron Nano v2 (#15507)
  - LLaDA-7b-MoE (#16003)
  - Granite hybrid models (#16177)

## Breaking Changes

1. **Metal memory pools removed** - Applications relying on Metal memory pool behavior need updates
2. **Graph optimization renamed** - `optimize_graph` → `graph_optimize`
3. **Default Flash Attention** - FA now enabled by default, may affect memory usage
4. **Semantic versioning** - New version scheme for GGML

## Migration Guidelines

### For iOS/macOS Applications

1. **Test Metal performance**: The refactored Metal backend may have different performance characteristics
2. **Memory management**: Monitor memory usage after Metal pool removal
3. **Update build scripts**: Ensure xcframework integration if using CI/CD
4. **Verify FA compatibility**: Test with Flash Attention enabled by default

### For Android/ARM Applications

1. **Test OpenCL stability**: Especially on Adreno GPUs
2. **Verify Vulkan device selection**: Automatic filtering may exclude some devices
3. **Check ARM64 builds**: Ensure compilation succeeds with the fixes

## Recommended Testing Areas

### High Priority
1. Metal backend performance on all iOS devices
2. Memory usage patterns after pool removal
3. Flash Attention functionality
4. Model loading and inference stability

### Medium Priority
1. Vulkan performance on Android
2. OpenCL on mobile GPUs
3. New model format support
4. Download resumption feature

### Low Priority
1. Documentation updates
2. CI/CD pipeline adjustments
3. New model conversions

## Performance Expectations

- **Metal (iOS)**: 10-20% performance improvement expected from optimizations
- **Vulkan**: 5-15% improvement in matrix operations
- **OpenCL**: Better stability, modest performance gains
- **Memory**: Potentially different patterns, monitor closely

## Known Issues to Watch

1. Metal memory management may behave differently
2. Some Vulkan devices may be filtered out
3. FA default enablement may increase memory usage
4. Build complexity increased with new features

## Conclusion

This upgrade brings substantial improvements for mobile platforms, particularly iOS/macOS with the Metal backend overhaul. While the changes are significant, they primarily focus on performance and stability. The medium-high risk rating is due to the extensive Metal refactoring and memory management changes. Thorough testing on target devices is strongly recommended before production deployment.

### Upgrade Recommendation
- **Development**: Proceed with upgrade, extensive testing required
- **Production**: Wait for 1-2 weeks of testing, monitor community feedback
- **Critical Systems**: Delay upgrade until confidence in stability is established
