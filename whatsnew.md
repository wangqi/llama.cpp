## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Metal optimizations**: Well-tested improvements that should enhance performance
- **Bug fixes**: Critical fixes for iOS build and Metal device detection
- **New model support**: Additional models shouldn't affect existing functionality
- **Build system migration to CMake**: Industry standard, more maintainable

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **KV-cache refactoring**: Significant changes to memory management may require testing
- **Vulkan synchronization rewrite**: Could impact stability on some devices
- **API deprecations**: Removed llama_kv_self API may break older integrations
- **Context shift default change**: May affect existing server deployments

### High Risk ⚡
- **Major architectural changes**: Multiple backend refactors may introduce instability
- **Performance optimizations**: Aggressive optimizations might cause edge case issues
- **Multi-platform support**: New architectures (RVV, PowerPC) might affect build stability

## Recommendations

### Before Upgrading
1. **Test thoroughly** on all target iOS devices
2. **Benchmark performance** to verify improvements
3. **Check API compatibility** if using deprecated functions
4. **Review build configuration** for CMake migration

### After Upgrading
1. **Monitor memory usage** due to KV-cache changes
2. **Validate Metal performance** on various Apple devices
3. **Test model loading** especially for MoE models
4. **Verify server behavior** with new context shift defaults

### Rollback Plan
Keep the previous b6131 build available for quick rollback if issues arise. The main breaking changes are:
- Removal of make build system
- KV-cache API changes
- Context shift default behavior

## Summary
This upgrade brings substantial improvements for iOS/Metal platforms with better performance and stability. The risk level is **moderate** due to significant architectural changes, but the improvements justify the upgrade with proper testing.
